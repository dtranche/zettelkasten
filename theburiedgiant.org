  A bit of an Edipeus (sp) story about the search for the truth and memories and whether it is
  better to let the past and the truth be buried.  Axl and Beatrice want to know about their past
  and if it is as filled with love as their current belief.  

  Gawain, is protecting the dragon since it keeps peoples memory of the evil Arthor did hidden and
  prevents war.

  Witsan wants people to know what happened to his people at the hands of the Britons. 

  Another recurring theme is black and white thinking, and obedience to a way of thought.
