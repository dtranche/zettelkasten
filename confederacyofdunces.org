* Synopsys

* Thoughts
  A character study, a comical farce, that feels like the author is trying to say something though I
  am not entirely sure what.

	Ignatious is loud, gross, borderline insane.  Not at all likable or kind.

	The characters in a lot  of ways seem to be depiciting the worst of our faults, racism,
	homophobia, religious bigots, mistreating the poor and elderly.  A lot of punching down.

	Making fun of Twain, Michael had to be hating that.

	Redemption, Mr. Levy? Myrna

* Vocabulary
- Doxy - a lover mistree - a prostitute
- supercilious  - behaving like one thinks one is superior
- hexerei  - magic  sorcery
