* B-Trees
A b-tree is a tree structure that is based on minimize the number of seeks that is not in memory,
this is done by having a large number of keys per node.

The maximum number of keys per node + 1, is the order of the b-tree.

B-Trees typically have an odd order.

The height of a b-tree is log_{m}(n) where m is the order of the b-tree and n is the number of nodes.
